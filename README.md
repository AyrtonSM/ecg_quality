# Nome Do Projeto

EKG Quality Predition Research. This project presents as a central theme the quality classification of EKG signals using Deep Learning techniques to learn the pre-existing signals and classify them in three possible categories: 
Acceptable, Semi-Acceptable and Not Acceptable. 
Thus, the present paper seeks to verify the feasibility of using an automatic solution using Deep Learning techniques with a focus on Convolutional Neural Networks to classify the quality of these signals.
